## � WHY CHOOSE XORIUM?

You are tired of paying for "FUD" crypters that get detected in 24 hours. You are tired of Webhooks getting banned.
**Xorium Stealer Pulsar** is not just a stealer. It is a **Military-Grade Cyber Weapon**.

We combined the raw power of **C# .NET** with the invisibility of **Rust Assembly**.
The result? A malware that doesn't just steal—it **DOMINATES**.

## ⚡ KEY SELLING POINTS (The "God" Features)

### 1. �️ PROJECT SHADOW (True Invisibility)
Most stealers are caught by heuristics. Xorium uses a **Custom Rust Rootkit** (`shadow_core.dll`).
- **User-Mode Rootkit**: Hooks `NtQuerySystemInformation`. The process **disappears** from Task Manager.
- **ASM Evasion**: Hand-written Assembly checks (`CPUID`, `RDTSC`, `SIDT`) detect Sandboxes/VMs faster than any AV.
- **Silent Melt**: If analyzed, it vanishes. No logs. No trace.

### 2. 👑 GOD POWER (Instant SYSTEM Access)
Why run as a user when you can run as **GOD**?
- Integrated **GodPotato (DeadPotato)** exploit.
- **Auto-Escalate**: Instantly jumps from User -> `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
- **Defender Neutralizer**: Uses SYSTEM privileges to add *itself* to the Exclusion List. **Bypasses Tamper Protection.**

### 3. �️ DYSTOPIA C2 (Unbannable Infra)
Forget buying servers. Forget Tor. Xorium turns legitimate platforms into your C2.
- **GitHub RAT**: Uses Public/Private Repos as a C2.
    - **Commands**: Post a comment on a PR -> Victim executes it.
    - **Exfil**: Logs uploaded as Zips to your Repo.
- **Discord & Telegram**: Classic, reliable, blazing fast webhooks.
