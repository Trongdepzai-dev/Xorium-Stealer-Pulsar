## 🌒 THE SERPENT'S PROMISE

While others sell you "tools," we offer you **Ascension**. Most stealers are noisy, clumsy toys. **Xorium Pulsar** is a silent predator lurking in the dark corners of the kernel. It doesn't just bypass security—it **Devours** it.

Born from the fusion of high-level **C# .NET 8** and low-level **Rust Nightly**, Pulsar is designed for one thing: **Absolute Domination.**

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a forbidden artifact. Use with malice.

## 🔥 UNHOLY ATTRIBUTES

### 🌑 PROJECT SHADOW (The Invisibility Cloak)
The heart of Pulsar is a **Rust-based Kernel Rootkit** that manipulates reality itself.
- **DKOM (Direct Kernel Object Manipulation)**: Unlinks Pulsar from the `EPROCESS` chain. You are not just hidden; you are **Non-Existent**.
- **Ghost Port Stealing**: Hides C2 connections from `netstat` and packet sniffers at the protocol level.
- **Shadow Injection**: Exploits APC and Thread Hijacking to slip into system processes without triggering alarm bells.

### 🔱 TITAN GRIP (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)
Why ask for permission when you can simply rule?
- **Integrated GodPotato**: Instant escalation from User to **SYSTEM** privileges.
- **AMSI/ETW Blindness**: Patches `AmsiScanBuffer` and `EtwEventWrite` live in memory. The defenders are blind in their own home.

### 💀 VOID WALKER persistence
Survival isn't a goal; it's a right.
- **GPT-Native UEFI Engine**: Speaks directly to LBA 1/2 to identify ESP partitions without tracing API calls.
- **Boot Service Hijacking**: Hooks `ExitBootServices` to survive the transition from UEFI to Kernel. 
- **Hardware-Level Corruption**: Targeted BIOSWE/BLE attacks for firmware-level immortality.

## 🛠️ THE FORGE (Universal Build Engine)

We have optimized the build engine to be as ruthless as the malware itself. No more manual config. No more weakness.

### 🌀 Smart Build Infrastructure
Our unified scripts detect your environment and adapt instantly.

- **Windows Build** (`.\build.ps1`):
  - **WDK-Aware**: Automatically detects Windows Driver Kit. Skips if missing, builds if present.
  - **Nightly Enforcement**: Forces Rust Nightly for the most aggressive optimizations.
  - **.NET 8 Power**: Compiles the plugin with the latest high-performance runtime.

- **Linux/WSL Build** (`./build.sh`):
  - Full parity with Windows scripts.
  - Cross-compilation support for the dark arts.

```powershell
# Summon the binary
.\build.ps1
```

## 🕯️ THE DARK PATH (Roadmap)

- [x] **Ring 0 Rootkit**: Rust Kernel Driver mastery.
- [x] **.NET 8 Migration**: Maximum execution speed.
- [x] **Smart Build Engine**: Zero-manual dependency orchestration.
- [/] **Git Integration**: Secure, versioned evolution.
- [ ] **HVCI Bypass**: Piercing the hypervisor code integrity.
- [ ] **UEFI Bootkit**: Persistence that outlives the hardware itself.
